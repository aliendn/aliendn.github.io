# Overview of Internet of Behavior (IoB)

Internet of things is playing a vital role in todays growing world. The data collected by the IoT devices provide valuable information about users behavior, interests and preference. This has brought a new way for technology that is called as **Internet of Behavior in short IoB**. The shift to mobile devices has changed the whole way of interaction of world. Now a days if we will see an individual’s day start with some IoT enabled digital devices and also ends with those IoT devices. Not only IoT devices provides services but also each moment IoT tries to make human’s life more easier and more comfort by improving it’s service. So, the data these IoT devices collect and later on analyzing it extracts valuable information about users behavior, interests and preferences. So, this was the point from where and when this IoB came into the picture. 

Seeing the current scenario of the country the pandemic is the temporary reason that  IoB  is in the list of latest trends. 

So, lets take a deep look at the Internet of Behaviors, its features, and finally the advantage and disadvantages of IoB.

**Internet of Behavior (IoB) :**

Basically IoB  is a process where an user data is analyzed in terms of behavioral psychology. With the result of the analysis it informs new approaches to designing a new service or product and how to market the end product in companies. So, the important point is collecting each digital activity data of user and finally to use this information to influence behavior.

**Features of IoB  :**

As companies are for customers and customers are the point to whom the companies focuses and plans it’s mission and vision. So, IoB can become a powerful new marketing and sales tool for business and organization all around in upcoming times. It helps in gaining a deep understanding for the customers which add a growth to the business.

Moreover implementing the emerging technologies innovations such as machine learning algorithm, IoB can capture, analyze, understand and respond accordingly to all the behavior in a way that allows tracking and interpreting the behavior of people.

**Advantage of IoB :**

* Analyzes customer buying habits across the platform.
* Studies the previously unobtainable data about how customers interact with devices and products .
* Gains deeper insights into customers interests and their buying experience .
* Quickly resolves issues to close sales and keep customers satisfied.
* Also helps in enhancing the security of public places and other internet things

**Disadvantages of IoB :**

* Data abundance and insight will be challenging to manage and secure an it will leads to  great cybercrime.


**Finally**, IoB is currently in its growing stage and may turn out as a life changing thing for people. IoB has come with tons of excitement to bring innovation and will bring a lot of change to the technological world. As the pyramid the IoT surely converts data to information but the IoB translates knowledge into real wisdom .

# Case studies

It is not difficult for companies to link a mobile phone with a laptop, with a voice assistant, with a smart home or with their vehicle. Marketing research from Google, Facebook or Amazon is becoming more and more comprehensive. The algorithms of these companies are configured so that they can anticipate customer desires and behaviours. The B2B sector is developing faster than B2C in IoB but it is only a matter of time before it becomes ubiquitous.

For example, software company BMC has developed a health app for smartphones that tracks diet, sleep patterns, heart rate or blood sugar levels. The app can alert to adverse situations in the user’s health and suggest behavioural modifications towards a more positive outcome. Health Passport (with apps such as Aarogya Setu in India, and The Health Code in China) and Social Distancing Technologies are partners in this emerging health technology.

In relation to transportation, Uber, for example, uses IoT data on drivers, passenger locations and preferences to reinvent CX. Also, large companies, such as Ford, have joined other start-ups, such as Argo AI, to design autonomous cars that vary their behaviour in each city based on vehicle traffic, pedestrians, bicycles and scooters.

Another software company, GBKSOFT, has carried out a project that also implements the IoB concept. The essence of the project was to help golfers improve their playing skills with the help of a mobile application and tracking of wearable devices, namely correcting existing ball striking technique and learning new techniques.  Making use of a handheld device connected to the mobile phone, each hit on the golf ball is recorded in the app and analysed (stroke force, trajectory, angle, etc.). As a result, the player can see their mistakes and get visual recommendations on how to improve their swing and stroke.

# Conclusions

Undoubtedly, A/B testing, SWOT analysis and many other techniques have helped companies for years to build their product and marketing strategies to create and promote that users would want to buy. The IoB will take this trend to the next level, and is set to generate considerable momentum in the development of the sales industry. According to Gatner, the technology may still be in its early days, but by the end of 2025, more than 50% of the world’s population will be exposed to at least one IoB programme, either from the government or a private company. It will be the ecosystem that defines human behaviour in an increasingly digital world.

For this reason, it will be essential to strike a balance between personalised offerings and intrusiveness to avoid adverse consumer reaction. Any company that chooses to adopt an IoB approach to its strategies must ensure that it has robust cyber security in place to protect all that sensitive data.

IoT-harvested data leveraged with IoB technology can be used to sell, but it’s not all targeted advertising. Organisations will be able to test, for example, the efficiency of their campaigns, both commercial and non-profit. Also, healthcare providers can measure patient activation and engagement efforts. In conclusion, its catalogue of applications is already extensive, but it will continue to expand as it becomes established in society.
